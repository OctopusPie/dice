# Javascript

The Javascript part is a REST API in NodeJS using Express.
To start the server be sure to have Node already installed.
Once installed use `npm install express` to download the service. Then in the terminal execute `node index.js` to start the server.
 > By default the listening port is `8080`. If you want to change it go to your `config.json` and set the port to your convenience at the field `TBD`.
## Routes
- `GET: /roll` : does nothing for the moment just to check the API status.
